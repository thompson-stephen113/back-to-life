                            I was told I should see a chiropractor, but I'm nervous about it. I mean, what exactly are chiropractors?

                            Chiropractors are doctors who practice the art of healing by adjusting, or manipulating, the spinal column. A healthy, well-aligned spinal column moving with full range of motion allows the nervous system to perform properly, which is vital because it controls every function of your body. To be licensed, chiropractors must have completed at least three years of university followed by four years at a chiropractic college.

                            That's entirely up to you. Some people only want to be treated for a specific pain or illness, and when the symptoms disappear, they stop going. Others use chiropractic care to fully correct the underlying cause of the symptoms and to remain feeling really well. Like a car, your body has constant stress and wear, and it benefits from a "tune-up". However, which treatment approach you want is always your choice.

                            No. Many of the pain-killers and drugs you buy to treat pain and illness cost more than chiropractic care. Yet chiropractic care treats more than the symptoms of poor health - it treats the underlying cause. It also helps to restore and maintain good health, without using any drugs.

                            A chiropractic adjustment is the use of a specific force in a precise direction that helps normalize spinal function. The adjustment is applied to a joint that is fixated, "locked up", or not moving properly. Adjustments help return the bones to a more normal position or motion, restoring the body's natural healing.

                            Adjustments help normalize spinal function and avoid bone and soft tissue degeneration. When nervous system function improves in this way, the body can begin the natural healing process.

                            After the adjustment, many patients report a sense of well-being or a feeling of calmness. Others feel improved mobility. Inflammation or muscle spasms may delay these positive effects. Chiropractors excel at making adjustments comfortable and effective.

                            A chiropractic adjustment corrects Vertebral Subluxations. An adjustment helps your body to restore itself to optimum health! When the 24 bones that protect the spinal cord lose their normal position or motion, delicate nerve tissue can become choked or irritated. If a thorough examination reveals malfunctioning areas of the spine, chiropractic adjustments are recommended to help correct this malfunction.

                <h3>Subluxations</h3>

                <p>"A subluxation is a complex of functional and/or structural and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health." Instead of treating your symptoms, your chiropractor is primarily interested in detecting, reducing, and preventing the Vertebral Subluxation Complex, because a person without subluxations is better off than someone with them.</p>
            
                <p>A subluxation, or more precisely, the Vertebral Subluxation Complex (VSC), describes what happens when spinal bones lose their normal position and motion from stress, trauma, or chemical imbalances.</p>
            
                <p>The VSC is the underlying cause of many healthcare problems. When one or more vertebrae lose their normal position and/or motion, they can interfere with the normal function of the nervous system that the vertebral bones were meant to house and protect. This interference can occur as pressure or irritation on the spinal cord, or on the nerve roots as they pass out of the spinal column. This nerve injury, or interference, is what doctors of chiropractic call the Vertebral Subluxation Complex - "vertebral" meaning relating to bones of the spine; “subluxation" meaning the improper motion or position of the vertebra; and "complex" meaning that the condition consists of many elements.</p>
            
                <p>Chiropractic is not the only health care discipline that recognizes the effects of the VSC. The effects of the VSC are generally relied upon and accepted among different healing disciplines, and they are being studied in many parts of the world.</p>
            
                <p>The Vertebral Subluxation Complex describes what happens when spinal bones lose their normal position and motion. Automobile accidents, improper lifting, alcohol, emotional stress, chemical imbalances, and long periods of sitting can cause the VSC.</p>
            
                <p>The primary job of the doctor of chiropractic is to detect, reduce, and help prevent the Vertebral Subluxation Complex using chiropractic manipulation as the primary form of treatment. Applying a carefully and precisely directed pressure to the spine in a quick manner by hand or special instrument, the doctor of chiropractic is able to restore normal motion and function to the spine, thereby reducing or eliminating the VSC.</p>

                <h3>Suggestions to Follow during Spinal Correction</h3>

                <ol type="1">
                    <li><span>DO</span> ice down the adjusted area, per doctor's recommendation.</li>
                    <li><span>DO</span> be sure to get plenty of sleep to allow your body to recuperate and repair.</li>
                    <li><span>DO</span> sleep on your back or side with your legs flexed slightly, not drawn up tightly. Avoid sleeping on your stomach.</li>
                    <li><span>DO</span> sleep on a firm mattress, preferably one that is neither too soft nor too hard, but just firm enough to hold your body level, while at the same time soft enough so that your shoulders, buttocks, etc., will depress into the mattress.</li>
                    <li><span>DO</span> rise from your bed by turning on your side and swinging your legs off the bed, then push yourself into a sitting position with your arms, thus minimizing the amount of strain on your back.</li>
                    <li><span>DO</span> participate in simple exercises that strengthen your body, but avoid jarring activities that place stress on your neck and spine.</li>
                    <li><span>DO</span> give it time. As with any medical treatment, healing with chiropractic is a process, not a magic pill. It takes time and is influenced by many factors. Over time, things should improve, and if necessary, we will adjust your treatment plan as we proceed. Changes to your condition can happen faster than anticipated, so enjoy them.</li>
                    <li><span>DO</span> keep a positive attitude and EXPECT positive results. As we follow through on your treatment plan, look for signs of improvement and take encouragement from them. Build an attitude that expects positive results and knows that profound healing is possible. Your belief and expectation has an incredibly strong influence on your body and is a key factor in healing.</li>
                    <li><span>DON'T</span> use any heat. No heating pads, heated ointments, hot baths, or hot tubs unless recommended by the doctor.</li>
                    <li><span>DON'T</span> sleep sitting in a chair or in cramped quarters. Lie down in bed when it is time to sleep.</li>
                    <li><span>AVOID</span> extreme bending of your spine in any direction.</li>
                    <li><span>AVOID</span> extreme stretching, reaching, or other over head work.</li>
                    <li><span>AVOID</span> sudden twists or turns of movement beyond normal limits of motion, especially the neck.</li>
                    <li>When lifting, keep your back straight and bend your knees to minimize the strain on your back.</li>
                    <li>When sitting, choose a chair that has adequate firmness to hold your weight comfortably, and then sit straight with your hips being higher than your knees. <span>AVOID</span> recliners.</li>
                    <li>When sleeping, your pillow should be neither too high nor too low. The ideal pillow is one that supports your head so that your neck vertebrae will be level with the rest of your spine.</li>
                </ol>
